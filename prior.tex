\section{Results From Prior NSF Support}

The most relevant prior NSF support for PI Groce is CCF-2129446, ``Feedback-Driven Mutation Testing for Any Language,'' with a total budget of \$500,000 from 9/2021 until 8/2024,
a collaborative proposal with Claire Le Goues of Carnegie Mellon
University. \textit{Intellectual Merit:} This project
focuses on allowing developers
to improve testing by using mutation testing to identify
weaknesses in tests.  This project has resulted in six
publications~\cite{cc2022,seip2022,fuzzing22,MindGap,ContextPMT,FSE24UM}
thus far and two major software releases.  \textit{
  Broader
  Impact:}  Work from this project has already
resulted in the reporting and correction of multiple bugs in software
systems, including widely used production compilers.  The focus on
practical discovery of software bugs and compiler testing in
low-effort contexts for expert developers working primarily in
low-level languages is a direct path to the proposed project's approach.
