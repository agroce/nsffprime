\subsection{PI Qualifications}

PI Groce has a long history with software analysis and verification,
including involvement in design and development of well-known model
checkers and fuzzing tools, and application of model checkers at
NASA/JPL on flight software for the Mars Rovers, including application
of and development contributions to, the SPIN and CBMC model checkers,
the TSTL testing tool for Python, and the DeepState unit-fuzzing
interface for C++ and C code.  Groce was the lead for design and
development of automated testing tools and specification languages for
the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity Rover) project.  He received
his PhD under the late Turing laureate Edmund M. Clarke, Jr., as one
of the first PhD graduates focusing on model checking for software
using SAT and SMT solvers.  More recently, he has primarily focused on
developing algorithms and tools for automated software testing; he is
the lead developer of the DeepState, universalmutator, and TSTL design and development teams.
Groce is the lead developer for multiple GitHub-hosted testing and
verification tools (including DeepState, the focus platform for this
project), all with more than 100 GitHub ``stars''; he reports 50-100
bugs detected using such tools to open source projects each year, and
has been awarded significant bug bounties for security-critical
compiler bugs detected using his work.  Groce was recently employed by
the Bitcoin Core team to investigate the effectiveness of their
fuzzing framework, a key component in ensuring the security of the
leading implementation of the most important cryptocurrency.  His work
has consistently invovled a marriage of deep theory of testing and
analysis with practical work oriented towards use by real-world
developers and implemented in working tools.
