The above approaches will be evaluated and designed in the context of
case studies based on actual FPrime models.  Initially, these will be
open source code, likely beginning with the FPrime system reference
from the FPrime community, and moving to actual flight projects as
available.  After initial work, we aim to collaborate with FPrime
users and team members at NASA/JPL to apply our prototypes to
in-progress missions in a non-disruptive fashion.  Finally, we will,
in the final months of the project, investigate developing a harness
transform mapping for a widely used framework with different
semantics and usage context, e.g. most likely AUTOSAR~\cite{AUTOSAR},
which is widely used in the automotive community, another important
domain for embedded systems with stringent correctness and reliability
requirements.

We will evaluate improvements to fuzzing (and other fault detection,
e.g., non-exhaustive model checking) approaches using both
traditional coverage and actual fault-based evaluations, and using
mutation testing.  There will be considerable synergy between
automation and extension of mutation for framework-based code and
evaluation of testing improvements for said code.
