\paragraph{Overview:} PI Groce is an experienced mentor of graduate students and junior reseachers.  PI Groce has been the chair of the doctoral committee for five students who have received doctorates in computer science (four of whom are now faculty members themselves), and has served or is serving on the committee for eight other PhD students, as well as mentoring 16 graduated masters' students.  PI Groce also supervised a post-doctoral researcher as part of a collaborative NSF proposal with the University of Utah, and has been chair of and a member of the ISSTA Doctoral Symposium, and served as a mentor at ICSE multiple times over the years.

He plans to apply methods he has previously applied to mentoring students.  Groce's graduate students are expected to participate heavily in the conception, development, empirical evaluation, and communication of research results, under the guidance of the PI. This mentoring plan is grounded in  widely-accepted best practices for mentoring of graduate research students.

\paragraph{Travel:} As a goal, the graduate research student will all attend at least one event to present research results, and ideally will attend two events.  

\paragraph{Grant Proposals:}  The graduate research student will be involved in the writing of any follow-on research proposals,
